This Programming Assignment contains the python code solution to the Normalization and Divisible by 3 problems.

Normaliation Problem
For the normalizaiton problem, i first inputted the numpy library using the "import numpy as np" code so that the following codes can use a high performance array called ndarray and so that i can also use the mathematical functions like "mean()" and "std()" which can help the code so that i can easily process the mean and standard deviations of the array. Next i generated a 5 x 5 array that have random values using the code "np.random.random(5,5)". Next i calculated the normalized score using the formula "(X - X.mean())/ X.std()" and set the values into the array "X_normalized". Lastly i displayed the array of "X_normalized" so that i can check if the value
